# AWS EKS

Elastic Kubernetes Service is a Managed AWS Kubernetes offering. Where AWS manages the Comtrol Plane and allows users to manage the Data Plane.

### Advantages:
```
Managed Control Plane: EKS takes care of managing the Kubernetes control plane components, such as the API server, controller manager, and etcd. AWS handles upgrades, patches, and ensures high availability of the control plane.

Automated Updates: EKS automatically updates the Kubernetes version, eliminating the need for manual intervention and ensuring that the cluster stays up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.

Scalability: EKS can automatically scale the Kubernetes control plane based on demand, ensuring the cluster remains responsive as the workload increases.

AWS Integration: EKS seamlessly integrates with various AWS services, such as AWS IAM for authentication and authorization, Amazon VPC for networking, and AWS Load Balancers for service exposure.

Security and Compliance: EKS is designed to meet various security standards and compliance requirements, providing a secure and compliant environment for running containerized workloads.

Monitoring and Logging: EKS integrates with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring cluster health and performance metrics, making it easier to track and troubleshoot issues.

Ecosystem and Community: Being a managed service, EKS benefits from continuous improvement, support, and contributions from the broader Kubernetes community.
```

### Disadvantages:
```
Cost: EKS is a managed service, and this convenience comes at a cost. Running an EKS cluster may be more expensive compared to self-managed Kubernetes, especially for large-scale deployments.

Less Control: While EKS provides a great deal of automation, it also means that you have less control over the underlying infrastructure and some Kubernetes configurations.
